*** 26 April 2002
   Andrew Simpson <andrew.simpson@paradise.net.nz>

- General sweep through all the scripts cleaning up spelling and grammar.  Used
my native NZ (British) spelling conventions throughout.  Apologies to US
citizens!

- Changed to persistent database connections. (pg_pconnect).  On my machines
this gave a significant speed increase.

- Added a 'warning' error case for minor user errors that don't need an email
sent to the admin.

- Made the un-completed tasks show on the main page under the projects.
Late tasks turn red in colour.  They aren't 'clickable' links, better to
click through the project.

- Thickened up the graphical colour bar on the project page.  Renders better now
in Opera, Netscape et al.

- Added more description to the tasks on the project page. Projects completed on
project page now say 'completed' instead of 'x days  late'.

- Sub-tasks on the task page now show days to go, and whether task is late, or
completed.

- Added javascript 'confirm' messages to (most) delete functions. (Not
fully checked yet).

- Fixed syntax error in database backup dump script.

- Tracked down (and fixed) task_show.php database bug.  Bad 'join'
syntax and a missing 'FROM users' line caused *lots* of warnings in Apache logs.

- Following on from the above, reconstructed all the 'joins' in database
queries throughout program to be in better SQL syntax.

- Removed the join 'WHERE tasks.creator=users.id' from task_list.php and
task_project_list.  It didn't seem to do anything - and didn't work in
task_list.php.

- Fixed small bug in task_submit.php where admin takes over a task.

- Fixed syntax error in contact_add.php that caused 'Add' button not(!)
to be displayed.

- Fixed database error in usergroup_submit.php that prevented usergroups
being deleted.

- Fixed scripting error that caused 'add taskgroups' link to only partially
work.

- Various scripting, comments and html changes of a minor nature.
