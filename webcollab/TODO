*MySQL Transaction Support

Latest version of MySQL can use InnoDB tables with transaction support. In the 
current stable MySQL 3.x.x versions the InnoDB support defaults(?) to off.  
Should add an additional abstraction layer file (with transactions) for MySQL
with InnoDB turned on.

*Borland Interbase

Linux Journal readers survey put Interbase third in popularity behind MySQL and
PostgreSQL.  Had a quick look at the Borland documentation, looks feasible to
write an abstraction layer.

*Task Deadlines ahead of Project Deadlines

The code lets you put a task deadline ahead of a project deadline.  In real life 
this is not possible.  Possibly should error trap this.

*Popup Warnings

Some minor warnings could be popup boxes rather than a new screen.  So far I 
haven't worked out any practical way to do this without lots of (bloated) code 
and javascript.  Also want to maintain cross platform browser compatibility.

*Translations

Translation files are in /lang and /help.
