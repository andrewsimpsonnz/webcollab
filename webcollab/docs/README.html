<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>WebCollab was originally based on Core-lan-org software (CoreAPM) written by Dennis Fleurbaaij.
</p>
<p>We started using CoreAPM in November 2001 for project managing our telcommunications
cellsite deployment. Along the way, we made changes and improvements to the source code - most of
which were fed back into the main CoreAPM development tree.</p>
<p>Over time our version has slowly moved away from the main tree, and is now uniquely different
from the CoreAPM software. This source tree has now matured into software that is
significantly different than it's CoreAPM roots, and in our opinion (!), a very useful piece of
software.</p>
<p>We are still using WebCollab for the same cellsite rollout; it's also being used for numerous
other projects internally.  By March 2003, the time had come to release back to the community, and
let a wider range of users experience WebCollab.</p>
<p>As of August 2003, development of CoreAPM was officially halted and users recommended to use
WebCollab.</p>
<p>WebCollab has been developed on Red Hat Linux and run in a production environment with initially,
PostgreSQL, and later MySQL databases.  Although we do not develop in Windows, we have enough
reports of stable installations to recommend this as a working platform.</p>
<p>We hope that you enjoy using WebCollab; it's been fun bringing it to you.</p>
