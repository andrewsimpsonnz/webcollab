<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>WebCollab was originally based on Core-lan-org software (CoreAPM) written by Dennis Fleurbaaij.
</p>
<p>I started using CoreAPM in November 2001 for project managing a telcommunications cellsite deployment at my place of employment - a civil engineering consultancy. Along the way, I made changes and improvements to the CoreAPM source code; I become a contributor, then a listed developer to the CoreAPM code.</p>
<p>Over time my version slowly moved away from the main tree because we had need different needs and aims.  In time it became uniquely different from the CoreAPM software.
<p>We are still using WebCollab for the same cellsite rollout; it's also being used for numerous
other projects internally.  By March 2003, the time had come to release back to the community, and
let a wider range of users experience WebCollab.</p>
<p>In August 2003, development of CoreAPM officially ceased and the original developer recommended that users convert to WebCollab.</p>
<p>WebCollab has been developed on Red Hat Linux and Debian Woody and run in a production environment with initially, PostgreSQL, and later MySQL databases.  Although we do not develop in Windows, we have enough reports of stable installations to recommend this as a working platform.</p>
<p>I hope that you enjoy using WebCollab; it's been fun bringing it to you.</p>
