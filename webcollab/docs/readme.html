<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>WebCollab was originally based on the Core-lan-org software that was written by Dennis Fleurbaaij.
</p>
<p>I started using an early release of Core-lan-org in November 2001 for project managing a telcommunications cellsite
deployment at my place of employment - a civil engineering consultancy. Along the way, I made changes and improvements
to the Core-lan-org source code; I become a contributor, then a listed developer to the Core-lan-org project.</p>
<p>Over time the public version of Core-lan-org slowly moved away from our internal working version because we had need
different needs and aims. In time our version became quite different than the Core-lan-org software.</p>
<p>By 2003, sufficient development had been done to warrant creating a new open source project. And so in March 2003,
WebCollab was released on Sourceforge.  Meanwhile further development of Core-lan-org did not proceed, and the project
was abandoned in August 2003.</p>
<p>The original Core-lan-org code was specifically written for a PostgreSQL database.  The code now has a database
abstraction layer and runs either MySQL or PostgreSQL.  A calendar section and setup programs have been added. 
Documentation for the program has been written. The system logic has been formalised consistently through the program,
and practically all the code has been re-written and extended. Language abstraction has been added, enabling the
translation of Webcollab into numerous languages.</p>
<p>Work has also been done to enable WebCollab to work with Unicode (UTF-8) and other multibyte encoding systems.  This
is offered as an optional alternative, since MySQL prior to version 4.1 and PHP prior to version 4.3.0 have poor
multibyte support.</p>  
<p>WebCollab has been developed on Red Hat Linux, Fedora and Debian (stable/testing)  and run in a production
environment with initially, PostgreSQL, and later MySQL databases.  Although we do not develop in Windows, we have
enough reports of stable installations to recommend this as a working platform.</p>
<p>I hope that you enjoy using WebCollab; it's been fun bringing it to you.</p>
