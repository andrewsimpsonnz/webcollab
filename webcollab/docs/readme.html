<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>WebCollab was originally based on the ideas in the Core-lan-org software that was written by Dennis Fleurbaaij.
</p>
<p>I started using an early release of Core-lan-org in November 2001 for project managing a telcommunications cellsite deployment at
my place of employment - a civil engineering consultancy. Along the way, I made changes and improvements to the Core-lan-org source
code; I become a contributor, then a listed developer to the Core-lan-org project.</p>
<p>Over time the public version of Core-lan-org slowly moved away from our internal working version because we had need different needs
and aims. In time our version became quite different than the Core-lan-org software.</p>
<p>The original code was specifically written for a PostgreSQL database.  The code now has a database abstraction layer and runs
either MySQL or PostgreSQL.  A calendar section and setup programs have been added.  Documentation for the program has been written. 
The system logic has been formalised consistently through the program, and practically all the code has been re-written and extended. 
Language abstraction has been added, enabling the translation of Webcollab into numerous languages.</p>
<p>Work has been done to enable WebCollab to work with Unicode (UTF-8) and other multibyte encoding systems.  This is offered as an
optional alternative, since MySQL prior to version 4.1 and PHP prior to version 4.3.0 have poor multibyte support.</p>  
<p>By March 2003, the time had come to release back to the community to encourage further development, and so it was that WebCollab was
released on Sourceforge.</p>
<p>Meanwhile further development of Core-lan-org had come to a standstill.  Dennis Fleurbaaij announced the abandonment of Core-lan-org
in August 2003. In a note on the website he recommended that users convert to WebCollab.</p>
<p>WebCollab has been developed on Red Hat Linux, Fedora and Debian (stable/testing)  and run in a production environment with
initially, PostgreSQL, and later MySQL databases.  Although we do not develop in Windows, we have enough reports of stable
installations to recommend this as a working platform.</p>
<p>I hope that you enjoy using WebCollab; it's been fun bringing it to you.</p>
