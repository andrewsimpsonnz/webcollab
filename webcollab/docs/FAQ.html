<h1>WebCollab Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
<h3>START UP PROBLEMS</h3>
<dl>
<dt>1. "Initial installation works, but logging in as admin has no effect
(no error message either)."</dt>
<dd>This problem has often occurred with PHP 4.0.6 and lower.  WebCollab will
only run on PHP  4.1.0, or higher.  PHP 4.0.6 does not support $_POST[], $_GET[] or $_REQUEST[]
global arrays.</dd>
<dt>2. "Initial installation works, but logging in as admin gives a blank
screen."</dt>
<dd>Check that PHP has your database extensions compiled in.  From the command
line type 'php -m':<br>
<br>
# php -m<br>
Running PHP 4.2.2<br>
Zend Engine v1.2.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2002 Zend Technologies<br>
<br>
[PHP Modules]<br>
mysql<br>
pgsql<br>
<br>
[Zend Modules]<br>
<br>
#<br>
<br>
Look for mysql and/or pgsql as required in the modules listing that follows.<br>
<br>
Most likely cause is that the default file for php.ini has the mysql or pgsql
module line commented out.  Look for lines in php.ini like this:<br>
<br>
;extension=mysql.so<br>
;extension=pgsql.so<br>
<br>
Remove the semi-colon ';' from the module you want, and restart Apache. <br>
<br>
Also - many  Linux distributions have separate packages (*.rpm, *.deb, etc)
for the main PHP files and the MySQL/PostgreSQL PHP support.  You need to install the relevant
modulepackage as well.</dd>
<dt>3. "Can login, but the main page is not found (404 error)."</dt>
<dd>Check that the the parameter $BASE_URL is correctly stated in config.php.
 Did you remember to add the trailing slash "/" as the config file says?</dd>
<dt>4. During normal usage error messages about IP spoofing occur, and the user is logged out.</dt>
<dd>When a user logs in to a session, WebCollab stores their IP address in the database.  For the
remainder of that session, WebCollab expects the user to be at that IP address.  If the IP address
changes - as in a 'man in the middle' hack attack - WebCollab terminates the session for security.
This system is not foolproof, in some cases round-robin proxy servers can cause problems with
apparently changing IP addresses.  In this case change $NO_IP_CHECK in config.php to "Y".
<dt>5. "Does WebCollab use cookies?"</dt>
<dd>Yes, if possible. Cookies are preferred for session management, but aren't
reliable with all browsers.<br>
<br>
Webcollab attempts to set a session cookie at the login.  Additionally it
uses encoded URI's at this stage, also for session management.  If the session cookie is found to be
successful (ie the user's browser accepts the cookie), the encoded URI's are dropped. Otherwise
session management with encoded URI is continued.<br>
<br>
The session cookie lasts only as long as the current session.  It should be automatically destroyed
when the browser is closed, or the user logs out.</dd>
<dt>6. "Does Magic Quotes need to be set 'on' or 'off' in php.ini?"</dt>
<dd>No, WebCollab reads the magic_quote setting in php.ini, and uses addslashes() on input data if
magicquotes is 'off'in php.ini.</dd>
<dt>7. "Does Register Globals need to be 'on' in php.ini?"</dt>
<dd>The Register Globals setting does not affect WebCollab. For security reasons it has defaulted to
'off' since PHP 4.2.0.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>CUSTOMISING WEBCOLLAB</h3>
<dl>
<dt>1. Can the 'Done', 'Active', 'On Hold' etc, labels be changed?</dt>
<dd>Yes, all the parameters are defined in the language files in /webcollab/lang/ They can be easily
changed to suit.<br>
<br>
Alternatively, a new customised language file can be set up and defined in
/webcollab/lang/language.php</dd>
<dt>2. Can the splash screen image be changed?</dt>
<dd>Yes, add the new image to /webcollab/images/ and set the $SITE_IMG parameter in config.php</dd>
<dt>3. Can background colours and text styles be changed?</dt>
<dd>Yes, see the style sheet /webcollab/css.css.</dd>
<dt>4. Can external webserver authorisation be used instead of the login screen.</dt>
<dd>Yes, set the $WEB_AUTH parameter to "Y" in config.php.  Username is taken from the REMOTE_USER
environment variable set by Apache.</dd>
<dt>5. What web browsers is WebCollab compatible with?</dt>
<dd>WebCollab is valid HTML 4.01 and uses CSS1 cascading style sheets.  Some Javascript is used, but
this is not essential.  This means WebCollab is compatible with most contemporary web browsers. 
WebCollab is also mostly valid XHTML 1.0.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>UPLOADING FILES</h3>
<dl>
<dt>1. Error message about wrong configuration when uploading files with the file upload
feature.</dt>
<dd>For Linux and *nix: Make sure the /webcollab/files/filebase directory is writeable by the
webserver. This means the directory should be either owned by the webserveruser (usually apache, www
or www-data) or the directory must be world-writeable.<br>
<br>
Use 'chmod 777 filebase' from the files directory, and preferably move the directory outside the
webserver root - see item 3 below.</dd>
<dt>2. File upload gives message about server configuration not allowing uploads.</dt>
<dd>Check that the PHP configuration file, php.ini, is set to allow file uploads. Check that
'file_uploads = On', or file uploads cannot work.</dd>
<dt>3. File upload security.</dt>
<dd>If you use the default /webcollab/files/filebase directory, it is possible for users to navigate
to the directory with their browsers and view the files present.  WebCollab has the filebase
directoryprotected by a index.html file and .htaccess file, but this is not foolproof.<br>
<br>
Ideally, for good security move the file upload directory to outside the webserver root
directory.  WebCollab can accommodate an upload directory in any location of the local
file system - not just the webserver root directory.  Make sure the chosen directory is writeable
by the user that normally runs the webserver. </dd>
</dl>
<h3>EMAIL SETUP</h3>
<dl>
<dt>1. How does email work in WebCollab?</dt>
<dd>Early versions of WebCollab used the mail() function call in PHP.  In most cases it worked, but
it can be difficult, particularly with Windows machines.<br>
<br>
WebCollab now uses the standard SMTP protocol over TCP/IP to 'talk' to a mail server.  The mail
server can be remote or local.<br>
<br>
In config.php:<br>
<br>
$SMTP_HOST = DNS name or IP address of the SMTP server</dd>
</dl>
<h3>REMOTE DATABASE</h3>
<dl>
<dt>1. Why can't remote databases be used with PostgreSQL?</dt>
<dd>Since version 6.3 (March 1998) PostgreSQL uses unix domain sockets by default. TCP port will NOT
be opened by default. The TCP option can be enabled with the '-i' flag topostmasterand it's meaning
is: "listen on TCP/ IP sockets as well as Unix domain sockets".<br>
<br>
Usually the pg_hba.conf (PostgreSQL config file) also needs to be edited to allow TCP/IP
connections.<br>
<br>
Changing $DATABASE_HOST in config.php from "localhost" to anything else (including
127.0.0.1) without reconfiguring PostgreSQL will <u>always</u> prevent WebCollab from connecting
to the database.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>DATABASE TYPES</h3>
<dl>
<dt>1. What are the database types in the config file?</dt>
<dd>
<table>
<tr><td>postgresql</td><td>=&gt; Postgresql abstraction layer</td></tr>
<tr><td>mysql</td><td>=&gt; standard MySQL abstraction layer</td></tr>
<tr><td>mysql_innodb</td><td>=&gt; MySQL abstraction layer with innodb transaction
support</td></tr>
</table>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>TRANSACTIONS</h3>
<dl>
<dt>1. Are database transactions used?</dt>
<dd>The PostgreSQL abstraction layer always uses transactions to provide better security against
power failure (or crash) during writing causing errors, or other similar database
corruption.<br>
<br>
The mysql_innodb abstraction layer uses transactions.  For MySQL version 3.23.xx the database must
be correctly configured to allow innodb databases to be used.  See the online MySQL manual for
more details:<br>
<a 
href="http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/InnoDB_in_MySQL_3.23.html">
http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/InnoDB_in_MySQL_3.23.html</a><br>
<br>
 For MySQL version 4.0, and above, innodb database support is enabled by default.  For these
versions (and configured 3.23.xx versions) it is recommended that the database be created with
the mysql_innodb database creation script, and the mysql_innodb abstraction layer is used.
Using transactions significantly reduces the risk of corrupted databases.
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>DATABASE BACKUP</h3>
<dl>
<dt>1. Can the database be backed up?</dt>
<dd>Two UNIX based shell scripts are provided in /webcollab/db for backing up WebCollab
databases.<br>
<br>
MySQL:<br>
<br>
<em>dump_mysql.sh</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usage: dump_mysql.sh &nbsp;&lt;database user&gt;&nbsp;&lt;database
name&gt;&nbsp;&lt;databasepassword&gt;<br>
<br>
PostgreSQL:<br>
<br>
<em>dump_postgresql.sh</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usage: dump_postgresql.sh &nbsp;&lt;database name&gt;<br>
<br>
Both dump into a plain text file.  They can be automated with a cron job and emailed to a back
up machine at regular intervals. </dd>
