<h3>SETUP PROBLEMS</h3>
<dl>
<dt>1. Setup program says that database can be created, but cannot write to the config file.</dt>
<dd>The web server does not/cannot have permissions to write to the config file.  You need to make the
config file world-writable.  The config file is <i>config.php</i> in the root directory of WebCollab.
<pre class="screen">
#chmod 666 config.php
</pre>
For security, reinstate afterwards with:
 <pre class="screen">
#chmod 664 config.php
</pre>
</dd>
<dt>2. How to upgrade from an earlier version of WebCollab?</dt>
<dd>Refer to the INSTALLATION file.  Briefly, all versions are upgradable by adding the new files.  Versions pre-1.40 and pre-1.60 need to have the database upgraded with the tools function.</dd>
</dl>
<a name="startup"></a>
<h3>START UP PROBLEMS</h3>
<dl>
<dt>1. "Initial installation works, but logging in as admin has no effect
(no error message either)."</dt>
<dd>This problem occurs with PHP 4.0.6 and lower.  WebCollab will only run on PHP  4.1.0, or higher.  Earlier versions of PHP do not support $_POST, $_GET or $_REQUEST global arrays, which are necessary for WebCollab to function.<br />
<br />
(The setup program now checks for early versions of PHP and will record an error).</dd>
<dt>2. "Initial installation works, but logging in as admin gives a blank
screen."</dt>
<dd>Check that PHP has your database extensions compiled in.  From the command
line type 'php -m':<br>
<br>
<pre class="screen">
# php -m
Running PHP 4.2.2
Zend Engine v1.2.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2002 Zend Technologies

[PHP Modules]
mysql
pgsql

[Zend Modules]

#
</pre>
<br>
Look for mysql and/or pgsql as required in the modules listing that follows.<br>
<br>
Most likely cause is that the default file for php.ini has the mysql or pgsql
module line commented out.  Look for lines in php.ini like this:<br>
<br>
<pre class="screen">
;extension=mysql.so
;extension=pgsql.so
</pre>
<br>
Remove the semi-colon ';' from the module you want, and restart Apache. <br>
<br>
Also - many  Linux distributions have separate packages (*.rpm, *.deb, etc)
for the main PHP files and the MySQL/PostgreSQL PHP support.  You need to install the relevant
module package as well.</dd>
<dt>3. Setup says "Your version of PHP does not have support for MySQL..." or "Your version of PHP does not have support for PostgreSQL..." and then dies.</dt>
<dd>This is the same as the problem above.</dd>
<dt>4. "Can login, but the main page is not found (404 error)."</dt>
<dd>Check that the the parameter $BASE_URL is correctly stated in config.php.
 Did you remember to add the trailing slash "/" as the config file says?</dd>
<dt>5. "Does WebCollab use cookies?"</dt>
<dd>Yes, if possible. Cookies are preferred for session management, but aren't
reliable with all browsers.<br>
<br>
Webcollab attempts to set a session cookie at the login.  Additionally it
uses encoded URI's at this stage, also for session management.  If the session cookie is found to be
successful (I.e. the user's browser accepts the cookie), the encoded URI's are dropped. Otherwise
session management with encoded URI is continued.<br>
<br>
The session cookie lasts only as long as the current session.  It will be automatically destroyed
when the browser is closed, or the user logs out.</dd>
<dt>5. "Does Magic Quotes need to be set 'on' or 'off' in php.ini?"</dt>
<dd>When magic_quotes set to 'on' in php.ini, input data is automatically feed through the addslashes() function for security.  WebCollab reads the php.ini file, and applies addslashes() on input data if magic quotes is set to 'off'.  The addslashes() function is important to prevent SQL injection attacks.</dd>
<dt>6. "Does Register Globals need to be 'on' in php.ini?"</dt>
<dd>Software written for early versions of PHP (prior to version 4.1.0) often requires Register Globals to properly receive input data. However for important security reasons Register Globals has defaulted to 'off' since PHP 4.2.0.  WebCollab does not require Register Globals.  You should leave Register Globals 'off' for better web site security, unless it is specifically required to be 'on' for other scripts.</dd>
</dl>
<a name="custom"></a>
<h3>CUSTOMISING WEBCOLLAB</h3>
<dl>
<dt>1. Can the 'Done', 'Active', 'On Hold' etc, labels be changed?</dt>
<dd>Yes, all the parameters are defined in the language files in /WebCollab/lang/ They can be easily
changed to suit.<br>
<br>
Alternatively, a new customised language file can be set up and defined in
/lang/language.php</dd>
<dt>2. Can the splash screen image be changed?</dt>
<dd>Yes, add the new image to /images/ and set the $SITE_IMG parameter in /config/config.php</dd>
<dt>3. Can background colours and text styles be changed?</dt>
<dd>Yes, see the style sheet /css/default.css.</dd>
<dt>4. Can external web server authorisation be used instead of the login screen.</dt>
<dd>Yes, set the $WEB_AUTH parameter to "Y" in /config/config.php.  Username is taken from the REMOTE_USER
environment variable set by Apache.</dd>
<dt>5. What web browsers is WebCollab compatible with?</dt>
<dd>WebCollab is valid HTML 4.01 and uses CSS1 cascading style sheets.  Some Javascript is used, but
this is not essential.  This means WebCollab is compatible with most contemporary web browsers. 
To the extent that most common browsers will accept, WebCollab is also valid XHTML 1.0.</dd>
</dl>
<a name="tuning"></a>
<h3>PERFORMANCE TUNING</h3>
<dl>
<dt>1. Can output buffering be used to speed up WebCollab?</dt>
<dd>WebCollab is normally very fast.  Most bottlenecks are caused by database performance rather than PHP throughput.<br />
<br />
The /includes/screen.php file contains 'commented out' code for compressed output buffering with ob_handler().  When this is enabled the output to the browser will be 'gzipped' before transmission, providing the browser is capable of accepting gzipped HTML - and most are.  However, there is a downside to this form of output buffering: Compression does not start until <u>all</u> the page is rendered by the web server.  This creates a noticeably high latency in page loading; for this reason the code has been 'commented out' in WebCollab.<br />
<br />
The preferred method of output buffering is with zlib.output_compression set in php.ini. Refer to <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.zlib.php#ini.zlib.output-compression" target="new_window">PHP Manual</a> for more information.  The downside of this option is that zlib.output_compression is not available on all versions or flavours of PHP.  
</dd>
<dt>2. Is caching worthwhile?</dt>
<dd>WebCollab uses a modular codebase with a high reuse factor.  Compiler caches will work well with WebCollab.  Ioncube PHP Accelerator has proven very compatible with WebCollab; Turck MMCache and Zend products should also work well.</dd>
</dl>
<a name="files"></a>
<h3>UPLOADING FILES</h3>
<dl>
<dt>1. Error message about directory not writable when uploading files with the file upload
feature.</dt>
<dd>For Linux and *nix: Make sure the /files/filebase directory is writable by the
web server. This means the directory should be either owned by the web server user (usually apache, www
or www-data) or the directory must be world-writable.<br>
<br>
Use 'chmod 777 filebase' from the files directory, and preferably move the directory outside the
web server root - see item 3 below.</dd>
<dt>2. File upload gives message about server configuration not allowing uploads.</dt>
<dd>Check that the PHP configuration file, php.ini, is set to allow file uploads. Check that
'file_uploads = On', or file uploads cannot work.</dd>
<dt>3. File upload security.</dt>
<dd>If you use the default /files/filebase directory, it is possible for users to navigate
to the directory with their browsers and view the files present.  WebCollab has the /filebase
directory protected by a index.html file and .htaccess file. Also, the filenames have a ID prefix added to them to prevent filename 'guessing' by attackers, but none of these measures are particularly foolproof.<br>
<br>
Ideally, for good security move the file upload directory to outside the web server root
directory.  WebCollab can accommodate an upload directory in any location of the local
file system - not just the web server root directory.  Make sure the chosen directory is writable
by the user that normally runs the web server. </dd>
</dl>
<a name="email"></a>
<h3>EMAIL SETUP</h3>
<dl>
<dt>1. How does email work in WebCollab?</dt>
<dd>Early versions of WebCollab used the mail() function call in PHP.  In most cases it worked, but
it proved troublesome with some SMTP servers.<br>
<br>
WebCollab now uses the standard SMTP protocol over TCP/IP to 'talk' to a mail server.  The mail
server can be remote or local.  Internally mail is handled by a purpose written SMTP mailer that is compliant to RFC 821 (RFC 2821), RFC 822, et al, for SMTP.<br>
<br>
In /config/config.php:<br>
<br>
$SMTP_HOST = DNS name or IP address of the SMTP server</dd>
<dt>2. My SMTP server needs me to use SMTP AUTH before accepting mail!</dt>
<dd>If SMTP AUTH is enabled in the config file, WebCollab will automatically login with 'plain', 'login' or 'CRAM-MD5' authorisation.  The required auth format is automatically detected.<br />
<br />
You need to set your login name and password in the /config/config.php file.<br />
<br />
WebCollab complies to RFC 2195 (CRAM-MD5), RFC 2554 (SMTP AUTH) and RFC 2595 (auth plain).</dd>
<dt>3. Can WebCollab handle non US-ASCII characters (i.e. Languages other than US English)?</dt>
<dd>For languages with more than "US-ASCII" characters (e.g.: French, German, Spanish etc), WebCollab
 attempts to send emails in 8 bit format.  This is accepted by almost all mail servers.  Sendmail, for instance, has had 8 bit support since 1993.<br>
<br>
If the upstream SMTP server does not advertise support for 8 bit mail, WebCollab reverts to 'quoted-printable' encoding.  This follows the requirements of RFC 1652 (8BITMIME), RFC 1869 (Extended EHLO), RFC 2045 (quoted-printable), and RFC 2047 (8 bit extensions).</dd>   
</dl>
<a name="security"></a>
<h3>SECURITY</h3>
<dl>
<dt>1. What are practical measures to increase site security?<dt>
<dd>
WebCollab has been coded with strong security measures.  In practical use WebCollab security has proven to be very robust.<br />
<br />
Practical measures to enhance security include:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Shift the uploaded file directory to outside the web server root.  WebCollab can write to anywhere
 in the file system. Check that the web server has write permissions for the chosen directory.  This 
 prevents uses uploading files, then navigating to the upload directory with a browser and executing
 the file.</li>
<li>Use a non-root user for the database.  The database user should have minimal privileges, and not be
 able to create and/or delete tables.</li>
<li>Make sure that Apache configuration allows .htaccess files to set &lt;Limit&gt; in WebCollab directory. WebCollab uses .htaccess files extensively to protect subdirectories.</li>
<li>Make sure the file <i>/config/config.php</i> is not world writable and not owned by the web server user.</li>
<li>Use an SSL layer for access with WebCollab.</li>
<li>Delete unecessary files.  For instance the /setup directory and update.php.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<a name="remote"></a>
<h3>REMOTE DATABASE</h3>
<dl>
<dt>1. Why can't remote databases be used with PostgreSQL?</dt>
<dd>Since version 6.3 (March 1998) PostgreSQL uses UNIX domain sockets by default. TCP port will NOT
be opened by default. The TCP option can be enabled with the '-i' flag to postmaster and it's
meaning is: "listen on TCP/ IP sockets as well as Unix domain sockets".<br>
<br>
Usually the pg_hba.conf (PostgreSQL config file) also needs to be edited to allow TCP/IP
connections.<br>
<br>
Changing $DATABASE_HOST in config.php from "localhost" to anything else (including
127.0.0.1) without reconfiguring PostgreSQL will <u>always</u> prevent WebCollab from connecting
to the database.</dd>
</dl>
<a name="database"></a>
<h3>DATABASE TYPES</h3>
<dl>
<dt>1. What are the database types in the config file?</dt>
<dd>
<table>
<tr><td>postgresql</td><td>=&gt; PostgreSQL abstraction layer</td></tr>
<tr><td>mysql</td><td>=&gt; standard MySQL abstraction layer</td></tr>
<tr><td>mysql_innodb</td><td>=&gt; MySQL abstraction layer with innodb transaction
support</td></tr>
</table>
</dd>
<dt>2. PHP5 is bundled with SQLite.  Why doesn't WebCollab support this too?</dt>
<dd>At present SQLite does not have sufficient date/time functions to work with the WebCollab code.
</dl>
<a name="transactions"></a>
<h3>TRANSACTIONS</h3>
<dl>
<dt>1. Are database transactions used?</dt>
<dd>The PostgreSQL abstraction layer always uses transactions because:
<ul>
<li>They provide better data security in the event of power failure or hardware/software crashes during database write operations.  Incomplete data is not witten to the database,  and data corruption or loss is avoided.</li>
<li>Without transactions it is possible for two users to alter the same data simultaneously, leading to data corruption.  With transactions this is prevented by design.</li> 
</ul>
<br>
The mysql_innodb abstraction layer also uses transactions.<br>
<br>
For MySQL version 4.0, and above, innodb database support is enabled by default.  For these
versions (and configured 3.23.xx versions) it is recommended that the database be created with
the mysql_innodb database creation script, and the mysql_innodb abstraction layer is used.<br />
<br />
For MySQL version 3.23.xx the database server <u>must</u> first be correctly configured to allow innodb databases to be used.  See the on line MySQL manual for more details:<br>
<a href="http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/InnoDB_in_MySQL_3.23.html">
http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/InnoDB_in_MySQL_3.23.html</a>
</dd>
</dl>
<a name="backup"></a>
<h3>DATABASE BACKUP</h3>
<dl>
<dt>1. Can the database be backed up?</dt>
<dd>Two UNIX based shell scripts are provided in /db for backing up WebCollab
databases.<br>
<br>
MySQL:<br>
<br>
<pre class="screen">
dump_mysql.sh
</pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usage: dump_mysql.sh &nbsp;&lt;database user&gt;&nbsp;&lt;database
name&gt;&nbsp;&lt;database password&gt;<br>
<br>
PostgreSQL:<br>
<br>
<pre class="screen">
dump_postgresql.sh
</pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usage: dump_postgresql.sh &nbsp;&lt;database name&gt;<br>
<br>
Both dump into a plain text file.  They can be automated with a cron job and emailed to a back
up machine at regular intervals. </dd>
</dl>
<a name="translation"></a>
<h3>TRANSLATIONS</h3>
<dl>
<dt>1. Can I translate WebCollab text messages to my language? And how do I do it?</dt>
<dd>The message translation files are in the /lang directory.  Using English as an example, there
 are three main files:
<ol>
<li><i>en_message.php</i> - message strings used in the program.</li>
<li><i>en_long_message.php</i> - long text descriptions used in a few screens.</li>
<li><i>en_email.php</i> - text used in the automated emails.</li>
</ol>
Each file contains a single string per line, with an <i>id</i> on the left hand side. For example:<br><br>
"planned" => "Planned (not active)"<br><br>
Translate the right hand side to your language.  Save the file (replacing 'en' with your language).<br><br>
The 'help' files are similar, but are mostly written in HTML text.  They are found in the /help directory.
</dd>
<dt>2. How do I install the translation files that I've written?</dt>
<dd>Either:<br>
<ul>
<li>Manually add the new files to the switch statements in <i>lang.php, lang_long.php & lang_email.php</i>.
 If you have some PHP programming experience, the correct format in the files will be obvious; or;</li>
<li>Send the translated files to the author (andrewsimpson@users.sourceforge.net), they will be returned
 with updated files.</li>
</ul>
Final step is obviously to alter the locale in the /config/config file.</dd>
