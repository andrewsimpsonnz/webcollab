  INSTALLATION for MySQL
  ======================


 1a. *Manual method*
     ===============

 - Choose a convenient database name

 - Make sure you know your database username and password

 - Create new database in MySQL

        # mysql -u 'database username' -p

           (Enter password when prompted)

        mysql> CREATE DATABASE 'database name';

        mysql> \q


  ( NOTE: 'database user', 'database name' and 'password' are your particular database values
    without the ' and ')



 - Change to ./db directory

 - Read schema

        # mysql 'database name' -u 'database user' -p < ./schema_mysql.sql


 - Go to Section 2. below


 1b. *Automated method*
     ==================

 - Choose a convenient database name

 - Make sure you know your database username and password

 - Change to ./db directory

 - Run './db_create_mysql.sh'

        # ./db_create_mysql.sh 'database username' 'database name' 'password'


 2. *Configuration*
    ===============

 - Fill in the config.php file

 - Login as admin / admin123

 - Click on 'Admin config' (near bottom of lefthand menu block) enter Admin Email (your email
   address), Reply-To (your address) and From (server email account, or your address).

  Enjoy!


  UPLOADING FILES
  ===============

 - Make sure the ./files/filebase directory is writeable by the webserver.

 - Ideally, for good security move the file upload directory to outside the webserver root
   directory.  Webcollab can accommodate an upload directory in any location - not just areas that
   are directly accessed by Apache.


  COMMON PROBLEMS
  ===============


 - "Initial installation works, but logging in as admin has no effect (no error message either)."

     - This problem has often occurred with PHP 4.0.6 and lower.  WebCollab will only run on PHP
       4.1.0, or higher.  PHP 4.0.6 does not support $_POST[], $_GET[] or $_REQUEST[] global arrays. 

 - "Initial installation works, but logging in as admin gives a blank screen."

     - Check that PHP has your database extensions compiled in.  Create a PHP file like this:
       
         <?php
           phpinfo();
         ?>
  
     - When viewed with a web browser it will list all the compiled options.

     - Most distributions have separate PHP packages for MySQL and PostgreSQL.
