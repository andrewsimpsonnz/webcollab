<a name=\"usergroup\"></a>
<p><b>User groups:</b></p>
<p>Most projects or tasks have a group of users working together in one specific area.  A Usergroup is
a group of users who share a similar work area.  Notification emails can be sent to the usergroup,
rather than just an individual user.</p>
<p>Usergroups can also be used to control access.  Access can be limited to just the Usergroup; in
which case other users won't see the restricted project/task, or be able to access them.  The
access restriction can be applied at project or task level by using the \"All users can view this
task?\" checkbox.</p>
<p>Where applicable, Usergroups also get their own private forum boards with each task and project.</p>
<br /> 
<a name=\"taskgroup\"></a>
<p><b>Task groups:</b></p>
<p>The differences between Taskgroups and Usergroups is not easily apparent to first time users.
However the difference is marked; Usergroups control access and information flow; Taskgroups are
merely for making the task listing more readable.</p>
<p>When a project grows to have a number of child tasks, the listing can appear long and not very
readable.  By putting tasks into a Taskgroup the list will be automatically grouped into
subsections (by Taskgroup) and be much more readable.  Tasks that have no Taskgroup assigned will
be grouped as 'Uncategorised'.</p>
<p>To summarise:  If no tasks in a project have a Taskgroup set, the task listing will be a long list.
If at least one task has the Taskgroup set, all the tasks will be listed by Taskgroup.</p>
<br />
<a name=\"globalaccess\"></a>
<p><b>All users can view this task?</b></p>
<p>This checkbox allows viewing of a task / project to be limited to the members of the selected
Usergroup only.  When the box is checked, all users can view the task / project.  Conversely, when
unchecked only members of the Usergroup can view.</p>
<p>For tasks: Users not in the selected Usergroup will be able to see the Tasks in the Project listing,
but will be unable to access them.</p>
<p>For projects: Users not in the selected Usergroup will not be able to see the Project or the
associated Tasks on any screen</p>
<p>If no Usergroup is selected, this checkbox has no affect.</p>
<a name=\"groupaccess\"><br /></a>
<p><b>Anyone in the usergroup can edit?</b></p>
<p>This checkbox allows all members of a Usergroup to edit the task / project.  When the box is
checked, all members of the Usergroup can edit this item.  If the box is unchecked, only the owner
can edit the task.</p>
<p>If no Usergroup is selected, this checkbox has no affect.</p>
<br />
<a name=\"summarypage\"></a>
