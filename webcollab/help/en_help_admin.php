	<p>This is the email address of the site admin that deals with day to day running of the site.

	<p>Automated emails from the site, particularly regarding users' accounts, will give this address as the person to contact.
	</p>
	<p>This address should always be set.  If in doubt, enter your email address here!

	<p><b>Email 'reply to':</b></p>
	<p>The 'reply-to' header field for emails from this site.

	<p>For emails to be sent to the usergroup, the 'send to usergroup' checkbox in Project/Task add (or edit), must be checked.</p>
	<p>This can be done by the default setting below, or by the user manually checking the box.
	</p>
	<p>Note that users can overide the default settings by un-checking the box manually.

	<p>Setting a usergroup to private does not affect the mailing list.</p>
