  Background
  ==========

We started using CoreAPM in November 2001 for project managing our telcommunications
cellsite deployment. Along the way, we made changes and improvements to the source code - most of
which were fed back into the main CoreAPM development tree.

Over time our version has slowly moved away from the main tree, and is now uniquely different from
the current CoreAPM software. This source tree has now matured into software that is significantly
different than it's CoreAPM roots, and in our opinion (!), a very useful piece of software.  

We are still using WebCollab for the cellsite rollout; it's also being used for numerous other 
projects internally.  By March 2003, the time had come to release back to the community, and let a
wider range of users experience WebCollab.

WebCollab has been developed on Red Hat Linux and run in a production environment with initially,
PostgreSQL, and later MySQL databases.  Although we do not develop in Windows, we have enough
reports of stable installations to recommend this as a working platform.
