Unicode Add-ons for WebCollab
=============================

Introduction
------------

The standard WebCollab package uses the ISO-8859-1 character set for the Western
European languages, and the ISO-8859-5 character set for Bulgarian language.  This
parameter is set in the xx-message.php language files in the /lang directory. 

This Unicode version of WebCollab converts the localisation to Unicode (UTF-8),
which natively supports over 650 languages.  Note that you will need to choose appropriate
fonts in your web browser - many fonts will only display basic Latin and selected other
characters.

Note:
- This code is written for PHP versions 4.3.0, and higher.  
- The optional multibyte strings library (mb_library) in PHP *must* be installed and
enabled.


Important Notes about MySQL
---------------------------

MySQL does not fully support Unicode before version 4.1. 
This code will work with most versions MySQL, but table indexing will be
incorrect.

The MySQL manual recommends adding the run time parameter of
'--default-character-set=UTF-8', and either dumping and restoring
existing databases, or rebuilding the indexes. The latter requirement is
apparently because mixed character set indexes do not work well with MySQL.

PostgreSQL fully supports Unicode and is recommended.
