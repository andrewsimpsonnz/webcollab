Unicode Add-ons for WebCollab
=============================

Introduction
------------

The standard WebCollab package uses a single byte character set specific to the
language being used. This parameter is set in the xx-message.php language files
in the /lang directory.

This method has two major disadvantages: Because it is single byte, only 255
different characters are possible (this is a problem with Chinese, Japanese for
instance).  Secondly, character sets cannot be mixed in a single application. 

This Unicode version of WebCollab converts the localisation to Unicode (UTF-8),
which natively supports over 650 languages.  Note that you will need to choose appropriate
fonts in your web browser - many fonts will only display basic Latin and selected other
characters.

Note:
- This code is written for PHP versions 4.3.0, and higher.  
- The optional multibyte strings library (mb_library) in PHP *must* be installed and
  enabled.


Important Notes about MySQL
---------------------------

MySQL does not fully support Unicode before version 4.1. 
This code will work with most versions MySQL, but table indexing will be
incorrect.

The MySQL manual recommends adding the run time parameter of
'--default-character-set=UTF-8', and either dumping and restoring
existing databases, or rebuilding the indexes. The latter requirement is
apparently because mixed character set indexes do not work well with MySQL.

PostgreSQL fully supports Unicode and is recommended.
