Unicode Add-ons for WebCollab
=============================

Introduction
------------

The standard WebCollab package uses a single byte character set specific to the
language being used. This parameter is set in the xx-message.php language files
in the /lang directory.

This method has two major disadvantages: Because it is single byte, only 255
different characters are possible (this is a problem with Chinese, Japanese for
instance).  Secondly, character sets cannot be mixed in a single application. 

This Unicode version of WebCollab converts the localisation to Unicode (UTF-8),
which natively supports over 650 languages.  Note that you will need to choose appropriate
fonts in your web browser - many fonts will only display basic Latin and selected other
characters.

Note:
-----

The optional multibyte strings library (mb_library) in PHP *must* be installed and
enabled.
